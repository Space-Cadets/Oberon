3. Read the Caveats (I personally boot psql each time I want to work but you can also setup 
background / startup processes. Here's a good [link for that](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/three-battle-tested-ways-to-install-postgresql))

4. Boot by typing ```psql``` in your shell

** How to Initialize your DB
