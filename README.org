 Fetches course data from Banner on a schedule
 Parses Course data and writes the data into a database

* Setup Instructions
** Install Postgres [OSX for now]

0. ```brew doctor``` to make sure your package manager is running properly
1. ```brew update``` to update brew package links
2. ```brew install postgres``` to install postgresql
3. Read the Caveats (I personally boot psql each time I want to work but you can also setup 
background / startup processes. Here's a good [link for that](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/three-battle-tested-ways-to-install-postgresql))
3. ```which psql``` should match /usr/local/bin/psql
4. Boot by typing ```psql``` in your shell

** How to Initialize your DB
1. ```createdb VillanovaCourseDB```
2. ```createdb TestVillanovaCourseDB```
3. Make sure your config is in the root of the local repository and then run ```python oberon.py```
4. Now try this ```psql VillanovaCourseDB``` and you should be presented with the CLI for postgres
you can even see your tables and relations by typing ```\d``` in the CLI

4. ```python setup.py [-filename]```
5. The database will now include all of the information from the HTML file
